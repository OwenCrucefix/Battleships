# Battleships

#Features
Currently it is nowhere near completion but once I finish it I hope for it to:
Have a single player VS AI game of battleships and a 2P Vesus game of battleships

#Details
This is just a program I started in a computer Science lesson and have decided to work on as a background project.

#Usage of scripts
You may use any of the scripts in this program however if you take anything large you must credit me for everything that you take, except the typing functions, that goes to Finlay Haggar

#Sources
